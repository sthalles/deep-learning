# Image Classification

## Introduction

The main topics covered in this notebook are:

**Exploring the dataset:** Here we visualize some of the training images to get a better felling of how the dataset looks like.

**Preprocess functions:** In this section we applied some normalization routines that will provide the model more capabilities of learning the patterns on the dataset. *One-hot-encoding*, *data randomness*, and *image normalization* are handle here.

**Build the network:** In this section we built some routines to create the Tensorflow computational graph. Some of the most basics and important Tensorflow constructions are handle in this section such as *tf.placeholder()*, *tf.Variables()* and *tf.Constant()*.

Some Deep Learning concepts such as **Convolutions**, **Activation Functions** (RELUs, softmax, etc), **Dropout**, **Pooling operations**, **Bias**, and **Fully connected** layers are discussed in details as well as the learning process using Backpropagation.

Finally, we explore the various combinations for tuning the model by changing some of its learning parameters such as the *learning rate* and the *epoch* size.
